# Repo To Ai Brief

Compress a repository into an AI-friendly brief.

## Why

Coding agents need concise repository context before editing.

This repository is intentionally small: it should be useful in one command, easy to inspect, and simple to fork.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexzhu0/repo-to-ai-brief.git
cd repo-to-ai-brief
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## Quickstart

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m repo_to_ai_brief examples/sample_repo
```

## Examples

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m repo_to_ai_brief examples/sample_repo
```

## API

The first release is CLI-first. Public Python APIs can be added after real usage proves the right shape.

## FAQ

**Does this call external AI APIs?**

No. The generated starter uses the Python standard library only.

**Is this production-ready?**

Treat `v0.1.0` as a focused utility release. Pin versions and review output before adding it to CI.
